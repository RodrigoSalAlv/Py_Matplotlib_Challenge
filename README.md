## Project Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this new analysis is to build an executive summary table with the detail of fares for each city type: Total Rides, Total Fare, Total Drivers, Average Fare per Ride, Average Fare per Driver.
Also a fare behavior for the first quarter of the year was builded to see the difference between city types.

## Results
### Analysis Resutls
With the executive summary we can clearly seen that the Urban Rides are the most profitables ones and the Rural Rides are the less ones, this speaking in terms of 'Total Fare". 
Due to the quantity of rides we can see that the Rural Rides are the most expensives, also we can see that the Rural Drivers are the ones who get more income per capita.

In the chart, we can see the behavior of the fares in each city type among a period of time. As expected the Urban Rides are the higher ones but they do not remain stable in the first part of the year.
The suburban rides are also not so stables in the first part of the year, and after the peak at the end of february we can see the fare goes down and stays low without the growth trend we saw in the firs part of the year.
The Rural Rides are the most stable ones among this four months sample, and apparently a growht tendency stable.

## Summary
Based in the information obtained in this analysis my recomendations are:
 - In the rural cities, the fare per ride is the higher one of the three city types, in this one we have a total of 125 rides in a period of 4 months: that's 1 ride per day. The stategy for rural rides could be, not increasing the quantity of drivers, but reducing the fare per ride at least to the fare we have in the suburban rides ($30.97). This could help to increase the rides in Rural Cities
 - For Urban Cities we can reduce the quanity of drivers, this due to also the quanity of rides we're having in a period of 4 months (1625) thats 14 rides per day, the average of drivers per city are 36. The half of drivers is not taking a ride in a daily basis.
 - The last strategy is also for urban cities: where we can fix a fare for short rides. It's more probable to get a short ride in a city, and due to conditions of traffic, demand and distance its probable to fix a fair fare.
